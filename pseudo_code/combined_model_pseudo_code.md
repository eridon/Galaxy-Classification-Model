# Preprocess and resize the test images

Preprocess and resize each test image in X_test

# Make predictions using the decision tree model

y_pred_decision_tree = Predict classes for the preprocessed test images using the decision tree model

# Make predictions using the neural network model

nn_predictions = Predict classes for the preprocessed test images using the neural network model

# Combine the predictions of the decision tree and neural network models

combined_predictions = []
For each index i in the predicted classes:
decision_tree_vote = Get the class with the highest probability from the decision tree predictions at index i
neural_network_vote = Get the class with the highest probability from the neural network predictions at index i

    If decision_tree_vote is the same as neural_network_vote:
        Add decision_tree_vote to the combined predictions
    Else:
        Create a list containing decision_tree_vote and neural_network_vote
        Randomly select one class from the list
        Add the selected class to the combined predictions

# Convert combined_predictions to multilabel-indicator format

Convert combined_predictions to the multilabel-indicator format with num_classes classes
