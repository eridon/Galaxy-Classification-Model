# Make predictions on the image using the trained CNN model

pred = Predict classes for the image using the trained CNN model

# Retrieve the predicted class name using the index from the class_names list

output_class = Get the class name associated with the highest probability class index in pred using the class_names list

# Print the prediction results

Print the predicted class probabilities in pred

# Print the predicted class

Print the predicted class name as output_class
